	<p>The Ceon URI Mapping module is a very handy module that no Zen Cart site should be without!</p>
	
	<p>Unlike other SEO modules, where the URIs are generated automatically when a customer visits a page, this module allows you to <strong>generate the URIs automatically</strong> within the admin, or even to <strong>enter your own specific URIs</strong> for each category/product/manufacturer/EZ-Page/Zen Cart page.</p> 

	<p>We believe this to be a much better solution as <strong>you are in control of your URIs</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>It lets you specify <strong>static, human-readable, keyword-based URIs</strong> to be used instead of the dynamic, ID-based URIs Zen Cart uses as standard.</p>
	
	<p>For example, for a product, instead of dynamic URIs like this:</p>
	<p class="Example">http://yourstore.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=5</p>
	
	<p>A static address - easy to read, easy to type in and full of keywords - could be specified for the product:
	<p class="Example">http://yourstore.com/books/life-is-good</p>
	
	<p>It's simple to <strong>promote sections of your site on advertising literature</strong>. For example, you could map the following static URI to your specials page:</p>
	<p class="Example">http://yourstore.com/EasterSpecials</p>
	
	<p>Ceon URI Mapping is packed full of features, which include <strong>full multi-language support</strong>, <strong>URI auto-generation</strong>, <strong>transliteration support</strong>, <strong>historical URI redirection</strong> and <strong>100% compatibility with Zen Cart</strong>, as well as many more!</p>
	
	<p><strong>Give potential customers easy to enter/remember URIs</strong> and <strong>improve your rankings in search engines</strong> - <a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/uri_mapping/features" target="_blank">check out the full feature list</a> and <a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/uri_mapping" target="_blank">download the module!</a></p>

	<legend><a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/uri_mappings_manager" target="_blank">URI Mappings Manager</a></legend>
	<p>The URI Mappings Manager makes it extremely easy to:</p>
	<ul class="BulletedList">
		<li>Generate URI Mappings for entire Categories at once (including their subcategories and all their products).</li>
		<li>Add, edit and delete URI mappings for other Zen Cart pages - no need to manualy edit the database!</li>
		<li>Add, edit and delete URI mapping aliases for other pages - optimise your site's keywords further! </li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have an existing store this will <strong>save you hours of work</strong> generating URI mappings for each category/product!</p>

	<h1 class="ExtraEmphasis">Match customers' addresses using Zones!</h1>
	<p>The Advanced Shipper Zones module is an extension to the Advanced Shipper 3 module which allows store owners to make use of the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Zones</em> that have been set up for the store.</p>

	<p>Specific <em>shipping methods</em> can be made available for a <em>Zone</em> quickly and easily by choosing the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Country</em> and <em class="ConfigurationOption">Zone</em> to which the shipping method applies in the Advanced Shipper Configuration Utility.</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/advshipper/demo" target="_blank">Advanced Shipper demo</a> has this module installed... try it out!</p>

<fieldset class="OtherReleases">
	<legend><a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/advshipper_localities" target="_blank">Advanced Shipper 3 Localities</a></legend>
	<h1 class="ExtraEmphasis">Limit customers' addresses to a set list of States/Areas/Cities!</h1>
	<p>The Advanced Shipper Localities module is an extension to the Advanced Shipper 3 module which allows store owners to set up a list of <em class="ConfigurationOption">States</em> (e.g. &ldquo;California&rdquo;, &ldquo;Florida&rdquo; etc.), <em class="ConfigurationOption">Areas</em> (e.g. &ldquo;L.A. Metropolitan Area&rdquo;, &ldquo;North California&rdquo; etc.) and <em class="ConfigurationOption">Towns/Cities</em> (e.g. &ldquo;Los Angeles&rdquo;, &ldquo;Long Beach&rdquo; etc.) for a <em>country</em>, which customers can use when they create an account on the site or add an address to their addressbook.</p>

	<p>Specific <em>shipping methods</em> can be made available to a <em>State</em>/<em>Area</em>/<em>City</em> quickly and easily by choosing the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Country</em> and <em class="ConfigurationOption">State</em>/<em class="ConfigurationOption">Area</em>/<em class="ConfigurationOption">City</em> to which the shipping method applies in the Advanced Shipper Configuration Utility.</p>
	
	<p>The <em class="ConfigurationOption">&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;</em> used for each <em class="ConfigurationOption">&ldquo;Locality&rdquo;</em> can be changed to a store's preferences (e.g. instead of &ldquo;State/Area/City&rdquo;, it could be &ldquo;Province/County/City&rdquo;).</p>
	
	<p>The module <strong>fully supports JavaScript remote loading</strong> so that, as a customer selects a <em>State</em>/<em>Area</em>, a dynamic list of <em>Cities</em> within that </em>Area</em>/<em>State</em> are displayed and able to be selected - <strong>there's no clicking &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and waiting on page reloads!</strong></p>
	
	<p class="Example">For Example, the counties of Northern Ireland, with an <em class="ConfigurationOption">area</em> &ldquo;Greater Belfast&rdquo; of &ldquo;County Antrim&rdquo; would appear as follows:
		<br /><img src="_images/advshipper_localities_example.png" alt="Example of State/Sub-locality Selection on the Create Account page." class="ExampleScreenShot" />
		<br />Selecting &ldquo;Greater Belfast&rdquo; would display the <em class="ConfigurationOption">towns/cities</em> defined for that <em class="ConfigurationOption">area</em>:
		<br /><img src="_images/advshipper_localities_example_city.png" alt="Example of City Selection on the Create Account page." class="ExampleScreenShot" />
	</p>
	
	<p>Now it couldn't be easier to limit shipping only to places the store actually ships, thereby avoiding unfulfilled, refunded or cancelled orders!</p>

	<p>Of course, for 100% compatibility, the module <strong>fully supports any browser that doesn't have JavaScript enabled</strong> so every customer will find it easy to sign up or add an address!</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/advshipper/demo" target="_blank">Advanced Shipper demo</a> has this module installed... try it out!</p>

	<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Advanced Shipper 3 Localities is <strong>not</strong> likely to upgraded to be compatible with Zen Cart 2.0.x, it is for <strong>1.2.x/1.3.x only</strong>.</p>
