<h3><a name="product_category_manufacturer_rates" id="product_category_manufacturer_rates"></a>Product / Category / Manufacturer Rates!</h3>
<p>The Advanced Shipper module allows <strong>individual products</strong> and/or <strong>entire product categories</strong> and/or <strong>all products from specific manufacturer(s)</strong> to have their own specific <em>shipping rates</em>!</p>

<p>There is no limit on the number of <em>method</em>s which can be defined, <em>products</em>/<em>categories</em>/<em>manufacturers</em>/<em>the whole store</em> can have multiple <em>shipping method</em>s if desired (E.g. &ldquo;Royal Mail 2nd Class&rdquo;, &ldquo;Royal Mail Next Day&rdquo; etc.)!</p>

<p>If there are various shipping options for the items within a customer's shopping cart, they are presented with all possible combinations of shipping methods for those items, so they can choose the method (combination) that best suits them!</p>

<p class="Example">For example, if a customer has a magazine in their cart as well as a bookcase, they can be offered the following options, which let them choose between normal or express delivery for the magazine while having the bookcase shipped via a pallet service:
	<br /><img src="_images/advshipper_method_comb.png" alt="Example of Shipping Method Combinations being offered to customer at checkout." class="ExampleScreenShot" /></p>

<p>Being able to specify exactly which products/categories/manufacturers use which method(s) makes it very easy indeed to set up almost any type of shipping arrangement, including <strong>complex drop-shipping arrangements</strong> etc., something most/all other Zen Cart shipping modules can't do.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>very few</strong> shopping cart software packages, commercial and/or open source, can match Advanced Shipper's functionality as integrated with Zen Cart, never mind its <strong>ease of use</strong>!</p>

<h3><a name="flexible_region_definitions" id="flexible_region_definitions"></a>Flexible Region Definitions</h3>
<p>There are multiple mechanisms for defining <em>Shipping Regions</em>, including  <strong>Geolocation</strong> (for AU, UK or US at time of writing) and <strong>Country/Postcode Matching</strong> - a hugely flexible option which allows you to set up <em>shipping regions</em> quickly and easily by matching against the customer's postcode/zipcode etc.!</p>

<p class="Note">With the extra <strong><a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/advshipper_zones" target="_blank">Advanced Shipper Zones</a></strong> module, an additional option, <strong>Country/Zone Matching</strong>, can be used to match against addresses using Zen Cart <em>Zones</em>. Stores which already have a list of <em>Zones</em> set up for shipping purposes may find this module very handy indeed!</p>

<p class="Note">Another expansion module, the <strong><a href="http://dev.ceon.net/web/zen-cart/advshipper_localities" target="_blank">Advanced Shipper Localities</a></strong> module, also adds additional options, <strong>Country/State Matching</strong> and <strong>Country/City Matching</strong>, which can be used to ensure that customers are only able to use a set list of <em>States</em>/<em>Areas</em>/<em>Cities</em>, thereby restricting shipping to places on that list!</p>


<h3><a name="comprehensive_rate_definition_options" id="comprehensive_rate_definition_options"></a>Comprehensive Rate Definition Options</h3>
<p><em>Shipping rates</em> are defined based on a combination of the customer's shipping address - the &ldquo;<em>Shipping Region</em>&rdquo; it is in - and the details for the <em>applicable products</em> for the method; the total <strong>Weight</strong>, total <strong>Price</strong> or the <strong>Number of Items</strong> of applicable products, or, <span class="NewFeature">new for 3.8.1</span>, the <strong>Total Order Price</strong> of <em>all</em> the <em>products</em> for an <em>order</em> (not just the total price of the applicable products for the method!).</p>

<p>If rates have been defined for individual <em>products</em> and/or <em>categories</em> and/or <em>manufacturers</em>, the overall rate will be calculated based on the composition of their shopping cart.</p>

<p>Rates can be entered as <strong>flat rates</strong>, <strong>percentage rates</strong>, as a <strong>joint percentage rate &amp; flat rate</strong>, as a <strong>block rate</strong>, as a <strong>series of combination rates</strong> or in several other ways...</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Percentage Rates&rdquo;</strong> allow rates to be set up by <strong>weight</strong>/<strong>price</strong>/<strong>number of items</strong> quickly and easily, without having to enter long lists of <em>limits</em> &amp; <em>rates</em>!</p>

<p class="Example">For Example, if a <em>shipping method</em> uses a courier service which charges by the Kg/lb, a &pound;1.25/Kg (or $1.25/lb) charge could be applied with the following rate definition:
	<br /><br />&lt;weight&gt;*:125%&lt;/weight&gt;
	<br /><br />For a 3.00Kg/lb order, this would be calculated as 125% x 3.00 = 3.75.
</p>

<p><strong><span class="NewFeature">[New for 3.8.0]</span> &ldquo;Block Rates&rdquo;</strong> provide for the charging of a set rate per &ldquo;block&rdquo;, or <strong>part</strong> of a block, of the <strong>weight</strong>/<strong>price</strong>/<strong>number of items</strong>. The <strong>weight</strong>/<strong>price</strong>/<strong>number of items</strong> is divided up according to a &ldquo;block size&rdquo;, which is rounded up to the nearest whole number of blocks, and multiplied by the specified rate.</p>

<p class="Example">For Example, if a <em>shipping method</em> uses a courier service which charges &pound;1.50 (or $1.50) for each 0.5Kg/lb or part thereof, the following rate definition could be used:
	<br /><br />&lt;weight&gt;*:[0.5:1.50]&lt;/weight&gt;
	<br /><br />For a 1.25Kg/lb order, this would be calculated as 3 x 1.50 = 4.50.
</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Combination Rates&rdquo;</strong> allow orders to be priced using multiple rates at the same time!</p>
<p class="Example">For Example, the same bookcase as above could be sent for an International Order by a <em>method</em> which used a <em>combination rate</em> which charged more per Kg for the first 10Kg than the second:
	<br /><img src="_images/advshipper_comb_rate.png" alt="Example of Combination Rate being applied to a 20Kg product at checkout." class="ExampleScreenShot" /></p>

<p><strong><span class="NewFeature">[New for 3.4.0]</span> &ldquo;Minimum/Maximum Rates&rdquo;</strong> make setting up rates even simpler by allowing the specification of a <strong>minimum</strong> or <strong>maximum</strong> rate to be applied to any rate calculation! For example, it's easy to state that a rate should be based on a percentage of the weight of the applicable products in the cart, but should cost a <em>minimum</em> amount. This works independently of any <em>surcharge</em> which can also be added on!</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Nested Tables of Rates&rdquo;</strong> - Advanced Shipper even allows <strong>multiple calculation methods</strong> to be used per individual <em>shipping method</em>! A <strong>very</strong> powerful option which allows ever more flexible shipping rate rules to be set up. For example:</p>
<p class="Example">&lt;price&gt;0-250: &lt;weight&gt;0-10: 2.50, 10-30: 4.50&lt;/weight&gt;, 250-*: 0.00&lt;/price&gt;
	<br /><br />For orders less than &pound;250 in value, shipping for orders weighing 0-10Kg will cost &pound;2.50 and for orders weighing 10-30Kg it will cost &pound;4.50.
	<br /><br />For orders over &pound;250, shipping will be free!
</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;UPS Rates Calculator&rdquo;</strong> - This can be used to have the module contact UPS for a custom set of shipping quotes for the applicable products. The <em>Source Country</em> and <em>Source Zipcode/Postcode</em> configuration options for each <em>region</em> of each <em>method</em> mean that it is easy to set up <strong>drop-shipping using UPS</strong> directly from a manufacturer or distribution centre etc., even for individual products/categories/manufacturers!</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;USPS Rates Calculator&rdquo;</strong> - This can be used to have the module contact USPS for a custom set of shipping quotes for the applicable products. The <em>Source Country</em> and <em>Source Zipcode/Postcode</em> configuration options for each <em>region</em> of each <em>method</em> mean that it is easy to set up <strong>drop-shipping using USPS</strong> directly from a manufacturer or distribution centre etc., even for individual products/categories/manufacturers!</p>


<p><strong>&ldquo;Contact Store Rates&rdquo;</strong> can be used instead of a numerical rate for individual <em>methods</em>, to have the module display a <em>&ldquo;Please contact the store for a personal shipping arrangement&rdquo;</em> message, instead of allowing customers to check out with the particular item(s) they have in their cart - a very handy option to have for awkward products/categories/manufacturers!</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Contact Store After Order Rates&rdquo;</strong> can be used to allow customers to check out with the particular item(s) they have in their cart but also to request that they <em>&ldquo;Contact the store for a personal shipping arrangement after completing your order&rdquo;</em> - so no potential sales are lost but the customer is still kept informed!</p>


<h3><a name="automatic_multiple_packages_support" id="automatic_multiple_packages_support"></a><span class="NewFeature">[New for 3.6.0]</span> Automatic Multiple Packages Support</h3>
<p>If there is a <strong>maximum weight</strong> of applicable products which can be sent in a single package, and the ability to split the order into multiple packages is available to the store, the weight at which the products will be split into another package can be specified.</p>
<p>Advanced Shipper will automatically work out how to combine the applicable products into the least number of individual packages possible. It will also take into account any packaging weight that must be added on per package!</p>


<h3><a name="packaging_weights" id="packaging_weights"></a><span class="NewFeature">[New for 3.4.0]</span> Packaging Weights</h3>
For rates being calculated using the <strong>weight</strong> of the applicable products, a table of <strong>packaging weights</strong> to be added on to the weight of the applicable products - before the rate for the weight is calculated - can be specified.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion to the rates themselves, the additional <em>packaging weights</em> can be specified using flat weights, percentage weights, flat &amp; percentage weights, block weights or combination weights!</p>


<h3><a name="surcharges" id="surcharges"></a><span class="NewFeature">[Rewritten for 3.8.0]</span> Surcharges</h3>
<p>As if all of that wasn't enough, an additional <strong>surcharge</strong> can also be specified for <strong>each</strong> individual shipping method/region!</p>
<p>It is <strong>simple</strong> to <strong>add on charges for insurance</strong> (for example, based on the total price of the products) or <strong>add on a charge for handling a large order</strong> (for example, one having several packages) etc..</p>
<p>The surcharge can be a simple flat rate, or can use its own, <strong>full table of rates</strong>, based on the total <strong>Price</strong> or the <strong>Number of Items</strong> of the applicable products, the <strong>Total Order Price</strong> of all products in the order (not just the total price of the applicable products for the method), the <strong>Shipping Rate</strong> calculated for the method, the total <strong>Weight</strong> of all the packages calculated for the method (all the applicable products plus the packaging) or the <strong>Number of Packages</strong> being used to ship the applicable products by this method!</p>



<h3><a name="method_availability_shipping_scheduling" id="method_availability_shipping_scheduling"></a>Method Availability Scheduling &amp; Shipping Scheduling</h3>
<p>Individual shipping methods can be set to be <strong>valid only for certain time periods</strong>, or a <strong>preferred shipping date</strong> (or selection of shipping dates) can be offered to the customer!</p>

<p class="Example">For example, a &ldquo;Saturday Delivery&rdquo; Method could be configured to be available from Thursdays (at 16:00) until Fridays (at 16:00).
<br />
<br />The Shipping Method would then only be available as an option from 4PM on Thursday afternoon until 4PM on Friday afternoon.</p>
	
<p class="Example">An example of offering a selection of shipping dates:
	<br /><img src="_images/recurring_methods_example.png" alt="Example of Offering Shipping Scheduling." class="ExampleScreenShot" /></p>
	
<p>In addition, it is also possible to set a <strong>limit on the number of orders which can make use of a particular shipping method</strong> within its availability period.</p>

<p class="Example">For example, any stores offering delivery services can stop taking orders for Saturday delivery after the 20th order has come in!</p>


<h3><a name="method_title_templates_placement_tags" id="method_title_templates_placement_tags"></a>Method Title Templates &amp; Placement Tags</h3>
<p>A very handy template system allows as much customisation of the <em>shipping title</em> as Zen Cart can facilitate.</p>
<p>Placement tags allow positioning of dynamic information about a <em>method</em> within its <em>title</em>, so each store can highlight the information it considers important or even disregard information it doesn't want to show the customer!</p>

<p class="Example">For example, stores can <strong>add descriptions of the shipping methods</strong>, giving the customer extra information about their policies in relation to respective shipping methods.</p>


<h3><a name="tax_support" id="tax_support"></a>Full Tax Support</h3>
<p>Each Region can have its own &ldquo;<em class="ConfigurationOption">Tax Class</em>&rdquo; setting and rates can be entered <strong>including</strong> or <strong>excluding</strong> tax, with an independent &ldquo;<em class="ConfigurationOption">Rates Include Tax</em>&rdquo; setting able to be configured for <strong>each</strong> Region for a Shipping Method.</p>


<h3><a name="admin_configuration_utility" id="admin_configuration_utility"></a>Intuitive Zen Cart Admin Configuration Utility</h3>
<p>It would be impossible to offer all the options that the Advanced Shipper module does using the standard Zen Cart configuration shipping module procedures so a complete Configuration Utility has been built from the ground up.</p>

<p>The JavaScript-powered Configuration Utility makes it easy to add, configure and delete <em>Shipping Method Configurations</em>, <em>Product/Category/Manufacturer Selections</em> and <em>Region Configurations</em>.</p>
