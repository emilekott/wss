<h2>Shipping Method Titles</h2>
<p>Details of the options for <em>method titles</em> follow, the less frequently used <em class="ConfigurationOption">Method Availability Scheduling</em> and <em class="ConfigurationOption">Method Shipping Scheduling</em> options are <a href="configuration_method_shipping_scheduling.html">described at a later stage</a>.</p>

<h4 class="UnderlinedTitle"><a name="method_admin_title"></a>Method Admin Title</h4>
<p>This is the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Title</em> of the <em>Shipping Method</em> that will be displayed alongside the <em>method</em>'s number <strong>in the admin only</strong>. It is intended simply to be used to aid in the configuration of the store's <em>shipping methods</em>.</p>

<p>For example, in a case where several <em>products</em> can be shipped using an &ldquo;Overnight Ground&rdquo; service but each <em>product</em> has an individual <em>rate</em> for that service:</p>
<p class="Example">Two separate <em>methods</em> may be defined, one for a &ldquo;Dining Table&rdquo; and one for a &ldquo;Bookcase&rdquo;.
<br />
<br />The <em class="ConfigurationOption">Method Title</em> to be displayed to the customer for both should be &ldquo;Overnight Ground&rdquo;, but in the admin this would be confusing as two <em>method</em>s would have the same name in the Method Management Utility.
<br />
<br />If the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Admin Title</em> of the first was set to:
<br />
<br />&ldquo;Overnight Ground - Dining Table&rdquo;
<br />
<br />and the second to:
<br />
<br />&ldquo;Overnight Ground - Bookcase&rdquo;
<br />
<br />..it would clearly be much easier to see which <em>method</em> was which, without having to examine each <em>method</em>'s summary!</p>

<h4 class="UnderlinedTitle"><a name="method_title"></a>Method Title</h4>
<p>This is the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Title</em> of the <em>Shipping Method</em> that will be displayed to the customer and recorded against the order once the checkout has been completed.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>It is important that this is clear and concise as it is the only record the store owner will have of the <em>method</em> selected by the customer; it is the text used to identify this <em>method</em> in the order's details!</strong>
<br />
<br />It is recommended that the name of the Shipping Service this <em>method</em> uses is part of the <em class="ConfigurationOption">title</em>!</p>

<h5>HTML</h5>
<p>The <em>method title</em> can make full use of HTML for more advanced layouts. For example, the title for a method, or its total cost, could be highlighted using &lt;strong&gt; tags.</p>

<h5><a name="method_title_templates"></a>Method Title Templates</h5>
<p>The templates which are used to lay out the information about a shipping method use HTML and can be found in the file <em class="FileName">includes/languages/english/modules/shipping/advshipper.php</em>. To change these templates, this file should be copied to the store's language templates folder and any changes made to this new file.</p>
<p>The hierarchy for these templates - that is, how each template is placed within any preceeding template - is clearly explained in the comments/documentation within that language file.</p>
<p>It is very simple but very flexible, allowing such things as creating a template to lay out information about a <em>product</em> which is being included in a <em>method</em>, with this template itself being repeated for each <em>product</em> that is included in the <em>method</em>.</p>

<h5><a name="method_title_placement_tags"></a>Placement Tags</h5>
<p>&ldquo;Placement tags&rdquo; can be used in the <em>method title</em> to position dynamic information about the respective shipping method. They can be entered directly in the <em>method title</em> or in the template.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Please Note</strong>: Once a <em>method title</em> uses any of these placement tags: {method_total}, {rate_calc_desc}, {surcharge_info}, {package_weights_desc} or {method_extra_title}, it no longer uses the default template and each piece of additional information will have to have a placement tag specified in the <em>title</em>, or a customised template, <strong>or it won't appear in the title</strong>!</p>
<p>The tags which can be used are:</p>
<ul class="BulletedList">
	<li><p><strong>{method_total}</strong> - This is the total cost for the <em>method</em>, formatted according to the current currency.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>{rate_calc_desc}</strong> - This is a description of how the final rate was calculated. An example of its output is:</p>
		<p class="Example">1 x $2.00 + 2 x $1.50</p>
		<p>If multiple packages are required to ship the <em>applicable products</em>, because a <em class="ConfigurationOption">Max Weight Per Package</em> setting is in place and the <em>applicable products</em> (and any packaging added on for them) breach this weight limit, a breakdown of the packages will also be part of the rate description.</p>
		<p>An example of the output in a situation where the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Max Weight Per Package</em> is 50Kg, and the courier service charges a &pound;0.15 per Kg for packages weighing 10-50Kg and a flat rate of &pound;2.50 for packages under 10Kg, is:</p>
		<p class="Example">3 Packages: 50Kgs x &pound;0.15/Kg + 43.5Kgs x &pound;0.15/Kg + 8.9Kgs: &pound;2.50</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>{surcharge_info}</strong> - This is the surcharge information for the method.</p>
		<ul  class="BulletedList">
			<li>It can use a custom <em class="ConfigurationOption">surcharge title</em>, specified in the <em>region</em>'s configuration.</li>
			<li>If a custom title has not been specified, the default title specified in the language file is used.</li>
			<li>The actual amount is formatted according to the current currency and placed wherever a <strong>{surcharge_amount}</strong> tag is found within the surcharge title. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>By allowing custom titles per region, more specific information can be provided to the customer.</p>
		<p class="Example">For example: A <em>shipping method</em> to a <em>region</em> could have &ldquo;Handling Fee: {surcharge_amount}&rdquo; while another might have &ldquo;Fuel Surcharge: {surcharge_amount}&rdquo;</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>{region_title}</strong> - This is the title of the region the customer's address is in (the region that is being shipped to). If the region has no title, the placement tag will be removed from the <em>method title</em>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>{package_weights_desc}</strong> - This is a description of the weights of the packages which would be sent via this <em>shipping method</em>. It is <strong>not</strong> intended to be used alongside any description of the rate calculations ({rate_calc_desc}) but <strong>instead</strong> of {rate_calc_desc}.</p>
		<p>It is designed to be used whenever it is desired to show how many packages the order contains, and what each weighs - if the corresponding tags ({package_weight}/{package_weights}) are used in the languages file - without displaying a breakdown of the rates for each package. An example of its output is:</p>
		<p class="Example">2 Packages: 145Kg + 65.35Kg</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>{method_extra_title}</strong> - When a <em>shipping method</em> is using a calculator, e.g. UPS/USPS, the exact name of the service being used is appended onto the <em>method title</em> by default. If this placement tag is used, this &ldquo;Extra Title&rdquo; is positioned in place of the tag, instead of simply being appended to the <em>method title</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>Date &amp; Time &ldquo;Placement Tags&rdquo;</h5>
<p>Special &ldquo;Conversion Specifiers&rdquo; can be used in the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Title</em> if the <em>method</em> has a value specified for its <em>&ldquo;Shipping Scheduling&rdquo;</em> to show information about the Date &amp; Time that the method will be shipped. These are <a href="configuration_appendix_a.html" target="_blank">explained later</a> in the section on <a href="configuration_method_shipping_scheduling.html">Shipping Scheduling</a>.</p>


<h5><a name="method_title_descriptions"></a>Method Descriptions</h5>
<p>Zen Cart has very limiting restrictions on how shipping information can be formatted. It allows for just a single <em>title</em> assoicated with a cost. The ability of Advanced Shipper to use HTML and placement tags in <em>titles</em> can be used in roundabout way to add descriptions for a <em>method</em>. An <a href="#method_description_example">example</a> of how to add a description for a <em>method</em> <a href="#method_description_example">can be found in the examples below</a>.</p>

<h4 class="UnderlinedTitle"><a name="method_title_examples"></a>Method Title Examples</h4>
<ol>
	<li>
		<h5>Example using the default method title template</h5>
		<p>The standard template for <em>method titles</em> is as follows:</p>
		<p class="Example">{method_title} ({method_total})</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h5>Example using the default method title template with Rate Calculation Descriptions</h5>
		<p>If <strong>either</strong> the <em>calculation method</em> is &ldquo;weight&rdquo; <strong>or</strong> percentage or combination <em>rates</em> are used in the <em>table of rates</em>, <strong>and</strong> placement tags haven't been used in the method's title, the actual weight of the <em>applicable products</em> or the calculation used to come up with the final <em>rate</em> will be appended to the <em>method</em>'s <em>title</em> using the template for rate calculation descriptions. The template for the method's title would then become:</p>
		
		<p class="Example">{method_title} ({method_total}) ({rate_calc_desc})</p>
		
		<p>For example, for a combination rate, this may result in the following:</p>
		<p class="Example">Royal Mail Next Day (&pound;3.75) (3 x &pound;1.25)</p>
		
		<p>As another example, if a simple rate was being used with a <em>calculation method</em> of weight, the following might be displayed:</p>
		<p class="Example">Royal Mail Next Day (&pound;4.50) (12.25Kg)</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h5>General Placement Tag Example</h5>
		<p>Using placement tags in the <em>title</em> allows for much more fine-grained control over how the <em>method title</em> looks.</p>
		
		<p>For example, placement tags and HTML could be used to create the following <em>title</em>:</p>
		<p class="Example">Royal Mail Next Day &lt;strong&gt;({method_total})&lt;/strong&gt;</p>
		
		<p>This would result in the total being highlighted but any rate calculations (or the weight of the <em>applicable products</em> if the <em>calculation method</em> was &ldquo;weight&rdquo;) wouldn't be displayed as the {rate_calc_desc} placement tag isn't present. An example of the output is as follows:</p>
		
		<p class="Example">Royal Mail Next Day <strong>(&pound;4.50)</strong></p>
	</li>
	
	
	<li>
		<h5>Placement Tag with Surcharge Info Example</h5>
		<p>As another example, if a <em>region</em> for a <em>method</em> had a <em class="ConfigurationOption">Surcharge Title</em> of &ldquo;(Fuel Surcharge: {surcharge_amount})&rdquo;, placement tags and HTML could be used to create the following <em>title</em>:</p>
		<p class="Example">Parcelforce Air &lt;strong&gt;({method_total})&lt;/strong&gt; ({rate_calc_desc}) {surcharge_info}</p>
		
		<p>This would result in the surcharge being placed after the (highlighted) total. An example of the output is as follows:</p>
		
		<p class="Example">Parcelforce Air <strong>(&pound;5.50)</strong> (1 x &pound;4.50) (Fuel Surcharge: &pound;1.00)</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h5><a name="method_description_example"></a>Method Description Example (Uses Placement Tags)</h5>
		<p>A description of the <em>method</em> can be added on a new line by preceeding it with a &lt;br /&gt; tag. If placement tags weren't used, the total would be appended to the description using the standard template, so obviously placement tags should always be used when adding a description!</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p class="Example">&lt;strong&gt;Royal Mail Next Day&lt;/strong&gt; ({method_total}) &lt;br /&gt;Choose this method for the quickest delivery, normally before 12 noon.</p>
		
		<p>This would result in the following output:</p>
		<p class="Example"><strong>Royal Mail Next Day</strong> (&pound;4.50)
		<br />Choose this method for the quickest delivery, normally before 12 noon.</p>
	</li>
