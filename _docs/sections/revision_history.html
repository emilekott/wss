	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">22nd June 2009</td>
		<td>3.8.1</td>
		<td>
			[ADDED] Support for UTF-8 added. Titles can now use any UTF-8 character (providing the Zen Cart installation itself has UTF-8 support enabled).
			<br />[ADDED] New calculation method added - totalorderprice - for matching against the total price of all the products for an order (not just the total price of the applicable products for a method!).
			<br />[ADDED] Support for minimum/maximum rates added for UPS and USPS calculation methods.
			<br />[ADDED] Support for Polish postcodes added.
			<br />[UPDATED] Default title for module being used in the language definitions file is no longer &ldquo;Advanced Shipper&rdquo;, but is now &lduqo;Shipping&rdquo;. The information/FAQ about changing this title has been updated also. Should hopefully prevent people making mistakes and trying, wrongly, to remove the title altogether (which causes the module to not get displayed at checkout).
			<br />[BUGFIX] Recent surcharge functionality update resulted in flat rate surcharges no longer working, this has been fixed.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Combination rates would incorrectly discount a value if inclusive limits were being used and the first minimum limit being tested against matched the value. As this was the first limit, there could not have been a previous rate band to which the value would have belonged. The combination rate code now correctly sees the value as included in the first rate band.
		</td>

	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">1st May 2009</td>
		<td>3.8.0</td>
		<td>
			[ADDED] Added support for block rates (for all of the rate calculation methods and surcharge calculation methods).
			<br />[ADDED] Geolocation support added for the US - full database of US zip codes now included as standard with the module!
			<br />[UPDATED] Surcharges can now use full tables of rates - dramatically increases their flexibility/usefulness! It's now easy to add on insurance for a method for example.
			<br />[UPDATED] The Advanced Shipper Config Utility now displays any store-side Region Title as well as the Region Admin Title in the method summaries.
			<br />[UPDATED] Geolocation functionality for the UK no longer rounds the calcuated distances, for slightly more accurate matching capabilities.
			<br />[UPDATED] Extra title for a method (e.g. UPS/USPS service information for the respectove quote) is now placed straight after the main method title if possible, otherwise it is appended to the method's title.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Region Admin Titles weren't being saved unless a store-side Region Title was entered.
			<br />[ADDED] Information about new block rates added to the documentation.
			<br />[UPDATED] Information about surcharges updated in documentation to use new format for surcharges.

		<td class="NoWrap">6th April 2009</td>
		<td>3.6.4</td>
		<td>
			[ADDED] Added support for adding a surcharge based on the number of packages being used to ship the applicable products for a method.
			<br />[ADDED] Added support for placement tags to be used to display information about the number of packages being used to ship the applicable products for a method, without having to display the full rate calculation.
			<br />[ADDED] Added support for a placement tag to place the &ldquo;Extra Title&rdquo; for a shipping method (the name of the shipping method as returned by live UPS/USPS quotes) at a specified position in the method's title, instead of it simply being appended to the method's title.
			<br />[BUGFIX] The packaging weight was being added on to packages after the contents of the packages had been worked out, according to any maximum weight per package setting. The packaging weight is now correctly being calculated at the time the contents of the packages are being worked out, so the checks against the maximum package weight are being compared to the overall package weight - i.e. that which includes the weight of the package as well as weight of the applicable products.
			<br />[BUGFIX] A surcharge title was being displayed in the method title when the surcharge was zero, it is no longer displayed when there is no surcharge.
			<br />[ADDED] Information about new placement tags and new number of packages options for surcharges added to the documentation. 
		</td>

	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">31st March 2009</td>
		<td>3.6.3</td>
		<td>
			[ADDED] New option added for regions, which calculates the total price of the applicable products including their tax, rather than the previous default of totalling up the price excluding tax.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Module was wrongly asking the customer to enter a state, when it couldn't find a usable rate, when the customer had typed a state in rather than having selected one from a state dropdown.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Negators for Country codes and Postcode Ranges were broken in versions 3.6.1 and 3.6.2.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Combination rates used by the Price and Weight calculation methods weren't displaying the rate calculations.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Maximum package weight functionality wasn't working properly with UPS and USPS calculators. Only the first quote was being properly totalled up and none of the quotes were returning the correct rate calculation descriptions.
			<br />[UPDATED] UPS and USPS calculators updated to inform the user if a post/zip code is required for the quote(s) to be calculated.
			<br />[ADDED] Several more FAQs added, mostly covering the formatting and display of the shipping information on both the store's catalog side and in the admin.
			<br />[UPDATED] Table of Contents added to FAQs page.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">23rd February 2009</td>
		<td>3.6.2</td>
		<td>
			[BUGFIX] Combination rates didn't work with the &ldquo;Number of items&rdquo; rate definition method. This was broken in versions 3.4.0 - 3.6.1 but is fixed now.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Combination rates were wrongly including any fixed rate for a rate band when the rate limits inclusivity was set to inclusive. This should only have occurred if the limits were exclusive.
			<br />[ADDED] Support for Indian postcodes added to module.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Documentation about Spanish postcode ranges fixed to include correct format for range specification for city of Valencia.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">9th February 2009</td>
		<td>3.6.1</td>
		<td>
			[ADDED] Support for selecting multiple categories at once for a method added to speed up configuration of methods.
			<br />[ADDED] Support for selecting multiple manufacturers at once for a method added to speed up configuration of methods.
			<br />[BUGFIX] A mistake in the SQL file for versions 3.4.0 - 3.6.0 meant that any new installation of the module using this file would have an incorrectly configured column type for storing any Packaging Weight settings. Upgrades were not affected by this bug.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Any postcode range or country negations which matched the customer's shipping address resulted in no further regions being checked instead of the the current region simply being skipped.
			<br />[BUGFIX] If no products or categories were selected for a method but at least one manufacturer was, a message indicating that no categories/manufacturers/products had been selected was incorrectly being displayed in the method's summary.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Broken link to Nested Table of Rates information fixed in Rates section of documentation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">18th January 2009</td>

			<br />[BUGFIX] UPS calculator failed upon checkout because the httpClient class wasn't being loaded in at the checkout process stage.
			<br />[UPDATED] Text referring to &ldquo;Product Catch-alls&rdquo; for methods updated to more accurately use &ldquo;Fallovers&rdquo;.
			<br />[ADDED] Documentation for Minimum/Maximum rates and table of Packaging Weights added.</td>

			<br />[UPDATED] Fixed typos in the module, where &ldquo;Manufacturers&rdquo; was spelt incorrectly.
			<br />[UPDATED] Fixed typos in the documentation, in the introductions for the examples for the UPS and USPS calculators.</td>

		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">12th August 2008</td>
		<td>3.2.0RC3</td>
		<td>[ADDED] Module now detects if it is being used by the shipping estimator and varies its &ldquo;No Quotes&rdquo; error message depending on how much of the shipping address the customer has supplied in the shipping estimator. Should encourage the customer to enter more shipping information if a quote isn't found, thereby increasing the chances of a quote being generated and minimising the appearance of the &ldquo;No Shipping Methods Found&rdquo; message.
			<br />[UPDATED] Information about rate bands with a total cost of 0 is no longer displayed in the rate calculation description and flat rates of 0 are now marked as &ldquo;Free&rdquo;.
			<br />[BUGFIX] The surcharge amount wasn't being included in the value for the method_total placement tag.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Attribute information wasn't being added to the method title due to an incorrectly named placement tag.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Unused placement tags weren't being cleared from the method title.
			<br />[BUGFIX] The USPS calculator wasn't matching the correct service names in the response and therefore returning fewer quotes than expected.

			<br />[ADDED] Basic error checking for missing calculation methods tags in tables of rates added.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Geolocation functionality wasn't working as the definition method check was wrong. Even with the correct check, the postcode being checked against wouldn't have been right so it would always have failed!

	<tr>
		<td class="NoWrap">9th July 2008</td>
		<td>3.0.0RC1</td>
		<td>[UPDATED] Format of Table of Rates changed to use XML tags to specify the calculation method within the Table of Rates itself. Shipping Methods' &ldquo;Calculation Method&rdquo; settings are no longer used.
			<br />[ADDED] Module can now use embedded Tables of Rates instead of a specific rate. Allows using different calculation methods for a shipping method, based on the limits for the previous calculation method. (E.g. Price used up to 30.00, then weight used for any order value above 30!).
			<br />[UPDATED] &ldquo;Handling Fee&rdquo; renamed to &ldquo;Surcharge&rdquo;. New surcharge functionality includes ability to use percentage rates (and percentage+flat rates). Rates can now be calculated based on the weight, price or numitems for the applicable products or based on the shipping rate itself!
			<br />[ADDED] New output template system added for complete customisation of the output for a method combination (with product info) or a single method (with no product info).
			<br />[ADDED] Tag placement functionality added for method titles. Can now add information about the total cost, any rate calculation, any surcharge and the title of the region being shipped to!
			<br />[ADDED] Region Admin Title setting added. Descriptive region titles for the person configuring the shipping methods can now be used in the Advanced Shipper admin while a different, specific region title can be shown to the customer as part of the method's title (using the new {region_title} placement tag).
			<br />[ADDED] UPS calculator class added. Tag &ldquo;ups&rdquo; can now be used in the table of rates to direct the module to contact UPS for a quote for the applicable products. Config panel to set up UPS calculator added, including support for specifying the &ldquo;Source Country&rdquo; and &ldquo;Source Postcode&rdquo; - allows drop-shipping of products from alternative locations (e.g. straight from the manufacturer)!
			<br />[ADDED] Flag contact_after_order added to Advanced Shipper module which warns customers that they have to contact the store after checkout to finalise shipping arrangements/costs. Allows customers to complete their order before having to contact the store.
			<br />[ADDED] Geolocation support added for Australian postcodes.
			<br />[UPDATED] The text "Free" is now displayed instead of &ldquo;0.00&rdquo; in rate calculations.
			<br />[ADDED] JavaScript added to admin so that pressing the Enter key in a text field/on a radio button will cause the form to be submitted instead of the next button in the form to be activated. Previously a Delete or Selection button etc. would have been activated when the Enter key was pressed (in Firefox) which was unintuitive/unexpected behaviour.
			<br />[UPDATED] Module no longer requires modification of a core file to get the splitPageResults class to work with the method SQL query.

			<br />[ADDED] Checks added to admin to help prevent invalid Handling Fees being entered.
			<br />[ADDED] Information about Handling Fees now displayed in method summaries (always) and region summaries (when defined).
			<br />[UPDATED] Module now uses PCRE functions instead of standard POSIX regular expression functions as the POSIX functions are being moved to PECL in PHP5.3+.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Catch-alls for products with attributes were being ignored at checkout!
			<br />[BUGFIX] Information about catch-alls for products with attributes wasn't being displayed in the main method listing and method configuration (for methods being edited).
			<br />[BUGFIX] Minor CSS kludge introduced to combat CSS layout problems of region control panel buttons due to buggy CSS implementation by IE.

			<br />[ADDED] A new option for specifying rates added: a special &ldquo;flag&rdquo; can now be entered instead of a numerical rate, to have the module display a &ldquo;Please contact the store for a personal shipping arrangement&rdquo; message, instead of allowing customers to check out with the particular item(s) they have in their cart.
			<br />[ADDED] Checks added to enforce valid availability and/or shipping scheduling settings. Should prevent any erroneous date selections.
			<br />[ADDED] Checks added to admin to help prevent invalid Table of Rates being entered. Checks currently limited to limits/rates pairing format and limits format.
			<br />[BUGFIX] The additional flat rate charge wasn't being added on to the final total for percentage+flat rates.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Times weren't being reset properly in the Method Configuration in IE.

			<br />[BUGFIX] When being used in conjunction with the Advanced Shipper Localities module, if a region used a level 1 locality in its definition, any level 2 localities for that level 1 locality weren't being checked against the customer's level 2 locality, only the main level 2 locality was.
			<br />[BUGFIX] Module was incompatible with Zen Cart 1.2.x - now fully tested and working on 1.2.x!
			<br />[UPDATED] Debugging output substantially improved.
			<br />[UPDATED] Documentation updated due to user feedback - should be a little clearer in parts.
			<br />[UPDATED] Documentation updated to use new display class for better on-screen rendering. Better print output formatting also added. (Tested in IE6-7, Mozilla 2.x and Safari 3.x).
