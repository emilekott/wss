374	Luke Young 6ft 4 Vulcan Five Fin Surfboard	The Luke Young Vulcan has a rounded pin 5 fin convertible set up. The vulcan favours the heavier surfer in smaller, weaker surf. It has super low nose entry with natural mid to tail rocker allows the vulcan to perform better than the standard fish design, with a single concave flowing out into a light vee in the tail to aid the wide vulcan move from rail to rail. It also has an extremely full deck volume gives the vulcan the most possible buoyancy without compromising performance. The five fin set up means you can use this as a quad in smaller slacker surf and then convert it to a thruster as the surf picks up or you find yourself on a nice point break. This board comes with composite lokbox fins. The great thing about lokbox fins is you will never rip a box out. They have Unequaled adjustability - 1/2" of movement to find your "happy spot". Unique tapered cavity - NO sloppy or wiggly fins! The FinLok - resists damage on impact. LokBox has always been about performance.

651	Nalu Beads Wittering Glass Bead	The inspiration for NALU surf beads has been taken from the sea and it's ever changing moods and beauty from season to season. Maybe its in the shell we find strewn on the shoreline or in the many shades of turquoise we glimpse in the Atlantic breakers that tumble towards us. The thrill of being immersed in and at one with nature. What ever we do and wherever we may be Remember your time in wittering with the limited edition Wittering bead. Located a few miles south of the Cathedral City of Chichester, The Witterings has been a popular destination since Roman times. Then, as now, it enjoys a sheltered natural harbour, a sandy coastline, and - with much of this precious environment protected as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty - stunning scenery, an abundance of birdlife and timeless tranquillity. With it's own microclimate, little wonder the area is known locally as 'God's Pocket'. There are a wide variety of sports and activities available, such as Sailing, Windsurfing, Golf, Kitesurfing, Cycling, Surfing and Horseriding. Or you could just enjoy the simple pleasures of Birdwatching, Fishing or Walking. In contrast, the villages of East & West Wittering, Bracklesham, West Itchenor & Birdham - together have a wide variety of shops, hostelries & places to eat.

874	Firewire 6 ft 3 Activator FST 5 fin Surfboard	The Firewire Activator Surfboard is an all new model for April 2012. It is described as many as the dominator mk 2. A very simular pan shape to the Dominator but with a double wing tail. The double wing tail allows you to have a smaller tail and takes out the bulk you have in a dominator tumb tail. The swallow tail gives you the pivot points in the tail which many surfers prefer. The Activator also features a 5 fin setup which allows you to use it as quad in smaller or weaker surf and as a thruster as the surf gets bigger or more powerfull. The Activator is made in the Firewire FST construction which is FUTURE SHAPES TECHNOLOGY The rapid response flex memory in the Future Shapes Technology used in these boards yields great speed through the turns whilst the parabolic rail configuration guarantees 100% return memory for years. Firewire surfboards feature are leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to construction. The parabolic balsa rails flex at the start of a turn storing energy and rebound through the turn releasing built up energy in the form of speed. The spring back of the parabolic rails to the original rocker triggers rapid acceleration, like an arrow shot from a bow. The construction materials, a unique formulation of hi-tech epoxy resins and advanced composites mean that these boards maintain the lively feel you get with brand new polyurethane boards, but are up to 20% lighter and will last 5+ times longer. This manufacturing process has won environmental awards and has created a range of lightweight and durable custom boards that are quickly being recognised for their awesome performance, just ask Taj Burrow! 6 '3" x 20 5/8 x 2 9/16 Parabolic balsa rails Custom Spray 5 Fin set up FCS Fins All new 2012 Firewire Surfboards feature Nanotune coating NanoTune creates a super slick hydrophobic (water repellent) coating which cures to your board to dramatically increase the performance of your board Increased speed and greater thrust during manoeuvres Longer and smoother glide across the water surface, thus making it easier to catch more waves and power around those flat sections Less board stick when launching airs and providing more forgiveness on landings Extra barrier of UV protection as well as filling in all pores and pin holes that currently exist in today's manufacturing process, adding longer life to your equipment	Sporting Goods > Water Sports > Surfing > Surfboards	Surfboards > Shortboards	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=874&cPath=19	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/images/activatorFST2.jpg	new	in stock	549.00	Firewire Surfboards		874							AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:,AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:		10 kg		2012-12-25

878	Firewire 6 ft 0 Dominator FST Round Tail Surfboard	The Dominator is a very versatile board. The Dominator combines a full outline with a thick foil from nose to tail and a 5/4/3 fin configuration(use as a 4 fin quad or 3 fin thruster). The wide point has been moved back to reduce the nose profile, maintaining all of the speed but with none of the top turn drawbacks of retro nose outlines. Built with the flex characteristics and light weight of Future Shapes Technology, the Dominator paddles like it's turbo charged and does not track like heavier PU boards with similar dimensions. Take Charge! The rapid response flex memory in the Future Shapes Technology used in these boards yields great speed through the turns whilst the parabolic rail configuration guarantees 100% return memory for years.

914	Firewire Deviant FCS Fin	The Firewire Deviant FCS Fin. Moves between 6 & 9 degrees, increasing speed through turns & drawing tighter arcs than standard fins. The Deviant Fin, developed by Radcor Design Studio & Firewire, applies that same principle to the rear thruster fin. The Deviant automatically adjusts 7° of cant in either direction (14 degrees total range of movement) and noticeably increases speed & responsiveness by reducing rail-to-rail drag, & shortening the turn radius: your board will feel faster & looser. Throughout our testing we felt the benefits of the automatically canted rear fin immediately! The design is based on a neutral template for the first release which is very close to a FCS M5 or a Futures FEA outline. The Deviant Fin is a single rear fin suitable for a thrusters fin set up.

963	Quiver 6 ft 2 Hobbit Surfboard	The hobbit is a very similar board to the Bumble Bart but instead of having a rounded tail it has a squash and has a slightly bigger pan shape. The Hobbit is one of the Quiver teams favourite small wave boards, with the same deep single to double through the fins with slight vee off the tail as the Bumble Bart which gives you concentrated speed through the fins with great hold on deep bottom turns and carves. Medium rocker throughout with the shortened all round template means it sits in the pocket all day whether it.s upside down or the wrong way round! Great small wave board for the more advanced surfer or an ideal shortboard for those looking to progress but not quite ready for a standard hip shortboard. Luke Hart is based at the Quiver Factory in Newquay and shapes and finishes all his own models to maintain a very high standard of surfboard. His finishing and shaping is getting noticed. He currently has a good test team including Alan Stokes and Tom Butler just to name a few.. 6'2 x 20 1/8 x 2 9/16 FCS Fins Thruster fin set up British Made	Sporting Goods > Water Sports > Surfing > Surfboards	Surfboards > Shortboards	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=963&cPath=19	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/images/hobit.jpg	new	in stock	414.00	Quiver Surfboards		963							AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:,AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:		15 kg		2012-12-25

983	Wave Tribe 9ft Comp Surfboard Leash	The Wave Tribe 9 ft comp Surfboard Leash leashes are strong, the velcro is excellent, and we offer a one year guarantee. If you break it we'll replace it. How cool is that? Surfer's Path Magazine rated our leash "excellent." The Wave Tribe leash offers the best of all worlds: comfort, strength, reliability, and sustainability. Whether its double over ankle or double over head, this recycled leash has got your back. One more thing, just because our leashes are made with recycled plastic doesn't mean they are weaker. The recycled plastic is used to make the urethane cord, the technical components are all made from new molds and the combined result is most excellent. 9ft Comp Doesn't tangle using double swivel technology Stays attached with superglue like velcro Better for the planet made with recycled plastic ** NOTE Image is for illustration purposes, colour may vary.

1003	Lost 5'11 Bulkley The Whip Surfboard	The Lost Whiplash Surfboard is built for precision, tight radius, high speed and spontaneous surfing. The mind-set behind this board was anything not needed, take out. Low volume rails, vee deck, elliptical outline (No hip or bump in the tail) with narrower nose and tail block combined with an aggressive rail rocker and deep concaves to keep it moving make this the most sensitive and responsive board we offer. Not recommended for below average surfers, but for the guy who wants to elevate his performance to the highest level. This board performs best in the pocket of curvy waves of any size.

1008	Lost 6'0 Round Nose Fish Surfboard	The Lost Round Nose Fish Surfboard is the world&rsquo;s all-time best selling fish model. During the filming of 5'5" REDUX, the RNF and RNF Quad were updated and fine tuned. The nose has gotten wider again, and more conservative overall rocker and less concave make for a board that will hold speed in flats and produce harder, longer carves. A longer, less pronounced vee in the tail gives a more predictable feel out of turns, and a straighter outline adds drive and hold. The deep wing, influenced by MR's vintage twin fins, adds more control of high speeds and better bite in snaps and out of carves. It still paddles great, still makes you look good, but the updates allow harder, more powerful carving turns and a wider range of performance in more varied surf. 6'0 x 20 1/4 x 2 1/2 FCS Fin System Clear	Sporting Goods > Water Sports > Surfing > Surfboards	Surfboards > Shortboards	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1008&cPath=19	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/images/lsrnd.gif	new	in stock	499.00	Lost Surfboards		1008							AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:,AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:		15 kg		2012-12-25

1054	Firewire 5 ft 6 FST Sweet Potato Quad Surfboard	The Firewire Sweet Potato is the surfboard that is half the size of a longboard but catches as many waves, even when its small mush. Everyone that has surfed these boards has loved it in all conditions. The Sweet Potato is such an easy board to surf. It puts the fun back into surfing, from tiny ripples to head high surf! The rapid response flex memory in the Future Shapes Technology used in these boards yields great speed through the turns whilst the parabolic rail configuration guarantees 100% return memory for years. Firewire surfboards feature are leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to construction. The parabolic balsa rails flex at the start of a turn storing energy and rebound through the turn releasing built up energy in the form of speed. The spring back of the parabolic rails to the original rocker triggers rapid acceleration, like an arrow shot from a bow. The construction materials, a unique formulation of hi-tech epoxy resins and advanced composites mean that these boards maintain the lively feel you get with brand new polyurethane boards, but are up to 20% lighter and will last 5+ times longer. This manufacturing process has won environmental awards and has created a range of lightweight and durable custom boards that are quickly being recognised for their awesome performance, just ask Taj Burrow! 5'6 x 22 x 2 5/8 Parabolic balsa rails dual density EPS and advanced composite core Quad set up FCS Fins	Sporting Goods > Water Sports > Surfing > Surfboards	Surfboards > Shortboards	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1054&cPath=19	http://www.witteringsurfshop.com/images/potfst.jpg	new	in stock	545.00	Firewire Surfboards		1054							AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:,AT::20.00:,BE::20.00:,BG::20.00:,CY::20.00:,CZ::20.00:,DK::20.00:,EE::20.00:,FI::20.00:,FR::20.00:,DE::20.00:,GR::20.00:,HU::20.00:,IE::20.00:,IT::20.00:,LV::20.00:,LT::20.00:,NL::20.00:,PL::20.00:,PT::20.00:,ES::20.00:,SE::20.00:,GB::20.00:,GB::20.00:		10 kg		2012-12-25

1091	Firewire 6 ft 2 FST Bourez Squash Tail Surfboard	The Firewire Michel Bourez signature model is a high performance shortboard made to be smooth through the tightest of turns and also be powerfull and fast like Michel himself. This board features a 4mm single concave with an evenly balanced rocker from nose to tail. This board will be great for powerfull rail surfing anywhere in the world. The Bourez model is slightly wider then a 'standard shortboard' and is FST so you can ride them a couple of inches smaller then your usual PU shortboard. It has a shortboard pan shape with a squash tail ands is a thruster fin set up. The rapid response flex memory in the Future Shapes Technology used in these boards yields great speed through the turns whilst the parabolic rail configuration guarantees 100% return memory for years.

1159	Lost 5 ft 8 Sub Driver Surfboards	The Sub Driver was designed for Kolohe Andino specifically for small mushy waves. Kolohe wanted a board that was inbetween the sub scorcher and the Driver. So then the Sub Driver was born using the same template as sub scorcher with the rocker, bottom concave and rails of the Driver. More nose rocker and less tail rocker then the sub scorcher makes this Sub Driver one of the most versatile boards around. Ideal from waist high beach breaks to pumping reefs.
