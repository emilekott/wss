GRUNTA - To the far Northern end of Woolacombe Bay and really only accessible  by beach at Low tide, and by fairly steep cliff path at any other tide,  Grunta offers limited space and access.  Grunta could be seen as  part of the point rather than a beach in it?s own right and should only  be used by those willing to hike out via the steep cliff path, as it  becomes cut off soon after low tide. There are no beach facilities.  Beach is not patrolled.]]></description>

A beach break with short lefts and  rights, but it's only really a low to mid tide break as there are rocks  all over the place at high tide.

<description><![CDATA[The worldamp;rsquo;s all-time best selling fish model. During the filming of 5'5quot;  REDUX, the RNF and RNF Quad were updated and fine tuned. The nose has  gotten wider again, and more conservative overall rocker and less  concave make for a board that will hold speed in flats and produce  harder, longer carves.  A longer, less pronounced vee in the tail gives a more predictable feel  out of turns, and a straighter outline adds drive and hold. The deep  wing, influenced by MR's vintage twin fins, adds more control of high  speeds and better bite in snaps and out of carves. It still paddles  great, still makes you look good, but the updates allow harder, more  powerful carving turns and a wider range of performance in more varied  surf.

<description><![CDATA[Built for precision, tight radius, high speed, spontaneous surfing. The  mindset behind this board was anything not needed, take out.  Low volume rails, vee deck, elliptical outline (No hip or bump in the  tail) with narrower nose and tail block combined with an aggressive rail  rocker and deep concaves to keep it moving make this the most sensitive  and responsive board we offer. Not recommended for below average  surfers, but for the guy who wants to elevate his performance to the  highest level.  This board performs best in the pocket of curvy waves of any size.

For the first time ever,  many of the world's top surfers have been assembled to create the most  definitive skills and coaching manual for the sport of surfing.quot;Surfing:  The Manualquot; has step-by-step photographic sequences with intuitive  training captions, covering every manoeuvre in surfing. The chapters are  peppered with expert tips and insight from over fifty of the sport's  icons, such as Andy Irons, Laird Hamilton, Mike Parsons and Tom Carroll.  The book has several hundred full colour photographs by the top surf  photographers, to illustrate each move, or just inspire you.The book  flows from ocean knowledge and wave understanding, to equipment choice,  survival and etiquette, before getting to the heart of the matter;  take-offs, bottom turns, tube riding, tricks, arials and every manoeuvre  you could imagine. The final sections deal with such subjects as how to  turn professional, and how to win contests or ride extra large  waves.What makes it unique is the sheer number of professionals who have  taken the time to give away their insightful secrets and tips, for the  first time ever.]]></description>

The JP swallow tail shortboard incorporates similarities in areas such as concaves, rail shapes, foiling's, foam distribution and fin set-ups to a standard squash tail shortboard. The added bonus of a swallow tail is it's ease in turning and added ability to pick up waves.  This allows the board to give you outstanding performance in critical waves.

<description><![CDATA[John 'JP' Purten have recently been crowned Carve Magazine's best shortboard shaper.  These boards range from 5'4quot; to 6'2quot;. This board is specifically designed for the guys who are competent with their performance       surfing and are looking for a board that will perform in the smaller, less powerful waves.     This board incorporates a fuller plan shape similar to the hybrid.  It also incorporates performance board characteristics like concaves       and rail shapes, but with a more relaxed rocker and a different  bottom contour in the front third of the board. This allows the board       to catch waves easily and respond to acute turns making the board  feel narrower than what it actually is whilst maintaining full speed.            5'10quot; x 19quot; x 2 1/4quot;      FCS Fin System      Thruster Fin Set Up      British Made.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[John 'JP' Purten have recently been crowned Carve Magazine's best shortboard shaper.  This board is for the small to medium waves, they range from 6'0'' to 6'8'' ideal for surfers looking for something with float, manoeuvrability and speed in smaller conditions. Great for the  heavier surfer who struggles in these waves. Where some will useFish / longer boards, this board has the same concept as the SX  model but has a wider plan shape more akin to the original 80's thruster.It also has a bump wing allowing a more parallel plan/rail line  which gives more projection also giving it a pivot point to give better     rail to rail transition with the full plan shape. Fin positions  have been adjusted accordingly to maintain the performance aspect.           5' 10 quot; x 20 1/2quot; x 2 1/2quot;      FCS Fin System      Thruster Fin Set Up      British Made.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The BEAN transfers the performance of a standard shortboard into a more  compact design thatamp;rsquo;s incredibly fast and responsive in small-to-medium  size waves. A wider nose template distributes the volume forward while  extra width through the centre creates a platform for immediate start-up  acceleration. Low entry rocker further enhances speed while moderate  rocker through the tail provides maneuverability in tight sections. The  BEAN retains the thickness and foil of a performance shortboard and  combines a shallow single-to-double concave with vee through the tail  making it frisk, lively and a ton of fun.         5'9  x 19 1/2  x 2  5/16      Quad or Thruster set up      Low entry rocker      Single to double concave.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The spitfire has all the benefits of the Dominator but even more  performance. The SPITFIRE combines a Diamond tail and STEP-DOWN tail  rail, giving the SPITFIRE the tail bite of a thinner board, without  losing the Dominator's speed and flotation. The SPITFIRE offers the same  5/4/3 fin options and a low entry rocker for easy paddling.  The rapid response flex memory in the  Future Shapes Technology used in these boards yields great speed through  the turns whilst the parabolic rail configuration guarantees 100  return memory for years.  Firewire won the SURFBOARD OF THE YEAR award at the recent SIMA awards -  that's basically the surf industry deciding who has done the best job,  and is an extremely prestigious award.        5'8quot; x 20  x 2 3/8      parabolic balsa rails      EPS and advanced composite core      5 Fin set up      FCS Fin System]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Firewire Sweet Potato is the surfboard that is half the size of a longboard but catches as many waves, even when its small mush. Everyone that has surfed these boards has loved it in all conditions. The Sweet Potato is such an easy board to surf. It puts the fun back into surfing, from tiny ripples to head high surf!    The rapid  response flex memory in the Future Shapes Technology used in these  boards yields great speed through the turns whilst the parabolic rail  configuration guarantees 100 return memory for years.     Firewire  surfboards feature are leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to construction.  The parabolic balsa  rails flex at the start of a turn storing energy and rebound through the  turn releasing built up energy in the form of speed. The spring back of  the parabolic rails to the original rocker triggers rapid acceleration,  like an arrow shot from a bow. The construction materials, a unique  formulation of hi-tech epoxy resins and advanced composites mean that  these boards maintain the lively feel you get with brand new  polyurethane boards, but are up to 20 lighter and will last 5+ times  longer.     This manufacturing process has won environmental awards  and has created a range of lightweight and durable custom boards that  are quickly being recognised for their awesome performance, just ask Taj  Burrow!           6'0 x 23  x 3      Parabolic balsa rails      dual density EPS and advanced composite core      Quad set up      FCS Fins]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Wittering surf shop is one of the only stores in the country stocking the all new Patagonia wetsuits. We know how cold it can get in the winter and the need for ultimate stretch as well as comfort. All the staff have tested these suits out in the depth of winter.  The Patagonia R3  has merino lining that gives our wetsuits their added warmth without added  rubber. But our patented merino wool grid  is  just one part of the successful equation. The neoprene we use has a  high-density nitrogen cell structure for maximum warmth and durability,  the post consumer recycled polyester jersey increases durability while  minimizing environmental impact, and the quality craftsmanship and  attention to little details ensures a great performing, well-made  wetsuit.  Patagonia  wetsuits are decidedly warmer than standard nylon-lined suits. But  thatamp;rsquo;s not all. They also wear longer, dry faster and are more  environmentally conscious than other suits.  The R3 is made from 3mm neoprene, but due to its construction, it is as warm, if not warmer, than a standard 5/3mm winter steamer.         Dual neck gasket construction (internal and external) keeps water out       Overlapped front yoke for easy on/off       Chlorine-free merino wool grid lining for superior warmth      Seams which are single-needle blind-stitched on the outside using nylon-bonded thread and triple glued for extra      durability and strength; crotch seams are internally taped        Bar tacks (clean-finished and reinforced with a polyurethane      tab) reinforce wrist and ankle seams in high stress areas       Anatomically engineered, PVC-free kneepads are flexible and durable      3mm neoprene - but as warm if not warmer than a standard 5/3mm winter steamer]]></description>

The Deviant automatically adjusts 7deg; of cant in either direction  (14 degrees total range of movement) and noticeably increases speed  amp; responsiveness by reducing rail-to-rail drag, amp; shortening the  turn radius: your board will feel faster amp; looser. Throughout our  testing we felt the benefits of the automatically canted rear fin  immediately!

<description><![CDATA[The Xcel polypro rash vest works like a toasty thermal layer under your suit. The integrated hood and outer collar creates an excellent seal to prevent flushing and the polypro shirt adds extra warmth to your winter suit.        Titanium glideskin lined hood with peak and elasicated face seal      Outer collar to prevent flushing      Polypro works like thermals.        Note on Sizes  Although a polypro will stretch we've found the sizes come up fairly small. If in doubt or between sizes we suggest you consider the larger option. As always we'll happily refund or replace if it's not 100 perfect.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Dominator is a very versatile board. The Dominator combines a full outline with a thick foil from  nose to tail and a 5/4/3 fin configuration(use as a 4 fin quad or 3 fin  thruster). The wide point has been moved back to reduce the nose  profile, maintaining all of the speed but with none of the top turn  drawbacks of retro nose outlines.  Built with the flex characteristics  and light weight of Future Shapes Technology, the Dominator paddles like  it's turbo charged and does not track like heavier PU boards with  similar dimensions. Take Charge!    The rapid response flex memory in the  Future Shapes Technology used in these boards yields great speed through  the turns whilst the parabolic rail configuration guarantees 100  return memory for years.  Firewire won the SURFBOARD OF THE YEAR award at the recent SIMA awards -  that's basically the surf industry deciding who has done the best job,  and is an extremely prestigious award.        6'4quot; x 21 x 2 3/4      parabolic balsa rails      EPS and advanced composite core      5 Fin set up      FCS Fin System]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The concept behind the Screamer is simple ,design a board that paddles  fast ,takes waves early and is fast and controllable in as many wave  states/sizes as possible. To compensate for the narrow tail area we have  added single concave and channels ,these features effectively increase  the wetted surface area and force the water between the fins. They also  provide great lateral drive to the board so itamp;rsquo;s more comfortable than a  more conventional wide tail amp;lsquo;Fishamp;rsquo; style board when riding in critical  sections or near the pocket. And if that was not enough we fit the board  with Escapeamp;rsquo;s Convert fin set-up system so you can ride the board as a  quad ,thruster  ,twin ,two amp; a half ,five fin add to that different sizes and it is  endless. So one board finned right will suit any conditions you want  to surf in making this a perfect travel board.        6amp;rsquo;0quot; x 20 3/8  x 2. 5/8      Clear      5 Fin set up      FCS fin system]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[In the 1600sa Benedictine monk named Dom Perignon observed that wooden  stoppers wrapped in oil-soaked rags used to seal his bottles of sparkling wine often popped out, and so he replaced them with the conical pieces of cork to seal his bottles of sparkling wine.  Wave Tribe once again releases the World's First Eco Deck Pad.   Most  deck pads are made out of non environmentally friendly EVA plastic  (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate). We first tested recycled EVA pads but they  didn't hold up well---they were a bit soft and didn't quite offer the  right consistency.   After trying several different alternatives they came across CORK and after making and testing a cork + eva composite their research and development team were very pleased with the results and you will be too.    Cork Oaks live about 150 to 250 years. Virgin cork (or 'male' cork) is the first cork cut from generally 25 year old trees.   Another 9 to 12 years is required for the second harvest, and a tree can be harvested twelve times in its lifetime.        Cork amp; EVA      Three Piece Design      No ToxicPaints        Strong Bull Glue       L 12quot;  x  W 11quot; / back  5quot;        Arch height 3/8 :: Kick 1 1/4quot;]]></description>

Medium rocker throughout with the shortened all round  template means it sits in the pocket all day whether its upside down or  the wrong way round!!
